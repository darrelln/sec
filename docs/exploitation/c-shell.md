## C Shell

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
  char* name[2];

  name[0] = "/bin/sh";
  name[1] = NULL;

  execve(name[0], name, NULL);
}
```

### Notes

* Compile using:
```
gcc -static -o shell shell.c
```

* Including the ```-static``` flag statically links the actual system call code into the binary rather than referencing the system call (dynamic linking) which wouldn't load the ```execve``` code unitl run time.
  
* Will warn about 'implicit declaration of execve'. This isn't an issue, to make the warning go away add the following to the top of the file:

```c
#include <unistd.h>
```
