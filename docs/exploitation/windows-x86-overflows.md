## Windows x86 (32 bit) Buffer Overflows
### YouTube
#### The Cyber Mentor's 8 part series:

  * VulnServer
  * Immunity
  * Mona (github/corelan) for finding modules without memory protection
  * Metasploit module for cyclical bytes
  * Metasploit module for nasm
  * MsfVenom for payload generation

  This series uses a dll that has no memory protections enabled.

#### HackHappy "Buffer Overflow Tutorial in Windows with Exploit"

  * Quick program written in C and gcc'd on Windows
  * Mingw32 (Sourceforge) for gcc
  * Immunity
  * Mona for everything
  * Uses a ready-made payload that executes calc.exe

  This video exploits kernel32.dll which has memory protections enabled and uses Mona for everything.
